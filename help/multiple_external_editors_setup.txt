To set up multiple external editor selection:
    1. make sure labs package is installed
    2. copy userPreferences.json to root of MASSEParmUtilities folder
    3. edit userPreferences.json to add your external editors
The implementation is just a simple extension of labs open in external editor, before external editor is launched
we set up environment variable "EDITOR" to path in a json file, after launch we delete it, so that config file labs
tool creates still determines what editor is launched when using labs menu items.
